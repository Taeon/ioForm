# ioform

Yes, another PHP form builder.

This project is **currently in pre-Alpha** and as such is **in no way ready for production use**.

The intention of this library is to provide a simple way to create standards-compliant forms, with consistent layout, as well as implementing as simply as possible features such as validation and accessibility.
